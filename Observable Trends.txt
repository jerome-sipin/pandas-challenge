Observed trends in Heroes of Pymoli assignment

1. Heroes of Pymoli is more popular among males than females or other/non-disclosed, 
as it males take up over 84% of the playerbase. Items and/or gameplay content should appeal more to
males to increase revenue.  

2. The age range of Heroes of Pymoli players is roughly binomial. The peak players' age range is young, between
mid-teens into late 20s, but there are players somewhat equally spread out in other age ranges. However, to get 
the most revenue, items/gameplay content should appeal more to young males. 

3. The most expensive items, such as Final Critic or Oathbreaker, are likley to be purchased more. Maybe the items 
make the game easier, but it's clear that the item is good enough for multiple people to drop 4+ dollars on them. No matter what the reason, 
items on the higher end of the price spectrum should be strong to justify their high price tag.
