# pandas-challenge
This is my (Jerome Sipin) submission for the Python Pandas homework, specifically
for the Heroes of Pymoli option.

I don't really know what exactly to put here, so I'll just keep writing
about my experience going through the assignment. There was a lot of Googling
done, especially for what commands to do and for syntax, but that's
what's supposed to be happening anyways since there's coding involved.

It took a while to finish up this assignment, but it got a lot easier
after the halfway mark because at that point, it was mostly copy/pasting from
previous sections and editing the code to fit the requirements for the current
section.
